# 🎮 Pygame Migration Complete

## Summary

Successfully migrated **Dog Go Around** from Ursina to Pygame!

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Removed old Ursina code**
   - Deleted all Ursina-based game modules
   - Removed old documentation files

2. **Updated dependencies**
   - Replaced `ursina` with `pygame>=2.5.0`
   - Updated `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`

3. **Created new Pygame game structure**
   - `game/game.py` - Main game loop and state management
   - `game/config.py` - Configuration with Pygame-specific settings
   - `game/core/car.py` - Car physics with velocity-based movement
   - `game/core/track.py` - Oval track rendering with checkpoints

4. **Implemented UI with Pygame**
   - `game/ui/menu.py` - Interactive main menu with hover effects
   - `game/ui/hud.py` - In-game HUD with speed, lap, position displays
   - Pause menu overlay integrated into main game

5. **Updated entry point**
   - `run.py` - Command-line argument parsing for Pygame game

### 🎯 Game Features

#### Working Features

- ✅ Top-down racing view
- ✅ Smooth car physics (acceleration, braking, turning, friction)
- ✅ Oval track with checkpoints
- ✅ Camera follows player
- ✅ Main menu (keyboard + mouse)
- ✅ In-game HUD
- ✅ Pause functionality
- ✅ 60 FPS gameplay

#### Key Differences from Ursina Version

- **2D top-down** instead of 3D
- **Simpler physics** - no gravity, airborne states
- **Pygame rendering** - sprite-based instead of 3D models
- **Keyboard/mouse only** - no gamepad support yet
- **Single-threaded** - simpler architecture

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Start the game
uv run run.py --offline

# With custom player name
uv run run.py --offline --name "Racer1"
```

### 🐛 Known Issues

- ❌ Networking not implemented
- ❌ Settings menu non-functional
- ❌ No AI opponents
- ❌ Lap counting placeholder only
- ❌ No sound effects

### 🚧 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to continue development:

1. **Implement lap counting** - Track checkpoint passes
2. **Add AI opponents** - Simple follow-the-track logic
3. **Sound effects** - Engine, collision, UI sounds
4. **Multiple tracks** - Different track layouts
5. **Networking** - Multiplayer with websockets
6. **Results screen** - Show race times and winner
7. **Boost powerups** - Speed boost pickups

### 🎉 Success Metrics

✅ **Game runs without errors**
✅ **Main menu is interactive**
✅ **Car controls feel responsive**
✅ **Track renders correctly**
✅ **HUD displays information**
✅ **Pause menu works**
✅ **60 FPS performance**
